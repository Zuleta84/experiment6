#Experiment 1#
Creating a Modell-View-Controller Web Applications
the realization of this tutorial was easy to do but to achieve trough the codes thaht could be copied in the tutorial was more dificult.
the IDE used in my tutorials was intelij but i wanted to use Visual studio code but since the tutorial recomended use intelij i decide to use this one.
The codes offered in the tutorial had flaws when I copied and pasted them in intellij because I always had to solve problems like adding that maven dependency to the code.

I had the main problem when executing the application code. here all the time I present an error in java and it tells me that version 5 is not supported.
then i searched in the web for to fine solution. the first one was to update the java compiler.
I did but i get the same error mesage whe i ran the code of the aplication.
Then i make sure that i had the correct java version. i did but i get the same error. 
After i worked with the pom.xml fil.to fine a solution and i found the solution.
Before <dependecies> i added the section <properties> with the amve.compiler. this can see better in my code and git repositori added to this readme fil.
